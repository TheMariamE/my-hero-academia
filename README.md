# Anime Web Site - My Hero Academia 

This project consists of the [Prototype - Boku No Hero Academia](https://linky.design/my-hero-academia) created to adapt the most interesting information of an anime within a website, for this we use React to create the site. 

Boku No Hero Academia Prototype is the second project of the series "Web Designing My Favorite Anime of All Time" where I'll be creating various React Projects based on Anime that I've truly liked throught the years, hopefully finding the improvement of good practice on my React coding and a better implementation in the overall React Project.
